// [Server]
// showServerperfomance: Show the percentage of RAM memory that left for server to use
// showUptime: Show server uptime (HH:MM:SS)
// showLag: 0 = Clients see their ping from the server
// showPlayersCount: Show the amount of players playing on the server
// allowBots = if 1 then everyone can play from same IP, you can multiboxing, add minions etc. If 0 then only 1 IP is allowed to spawn in the game. 
It prevents from using bots on your server. Every client with same IP will be banned.
// allowSpawnCollision: If 0 then you (almost :P) can't spawn in others players BIGGER cells.
// rememberBannedPlayers: All banned players will be saved in 'banned.txt' file aka banned permanently from your server.

// preventUsingMacro: You can't use macros for faster mass ejecting.
// ejectMassDelay: Delay in miliseconds beetween next mass eject (default 150). Works only with preventUsingMacro = 1.
// ejectVirusBattleMassDelay: Delay in miliseconds beetween next virus battle mass eject (default 150). Works only with preventUsingMacro = 1.

// splittedCellRestoreTicks: Restore ticks of new created cell after splitting. Default 10.
// turboSplitSpeed: Speed of your cells after pressing Z aka turbo split (default 260)
// automaticMassEject: If 1, then you don't need to press W many times, just press it once and your mass will be ejected.

// allowVirusBattle: if 1, then you're allowed to eject virus battle mass by pressing Q.
// virusBattleMinimumCellMass: Only cells with mass more than this value will be able to eject virus battle mass (default 1000).
// virusBattleMass: Amount of virus battle mass that you eject (but you don't loose mass)
// virusBattleEjectSpeed: Speed of ejected virus battle mass.
// automaticVirusBattleMassEject: If 1, then you don't need to press Q many times, just press it once and your mass will be ejected.

// virusTypes: If 1, there will be only green viruses. If 2, there will be 2 types of viruses - green and yellow(more dangerous)
If 3, there will be 3 types of viruses - green, yellow, and red(most dangerous)

// chatAntiSpam: Anti spam system for chat
// chatAntiSpamDelay: Delay in miliseconds between each player can send message to chat
